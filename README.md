# supermarket_sales
In this project, I analyzed historical sales data from a supermarket to forecast sales trends and optimize stocking decisions for various departments. By leveraging Python and data visualization libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, I was able to uncover valuable insights into monthly sales patterns, department-wise average sales,etc.
